You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.\n\nAt the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Opus Labs CVBA cancels it.

Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.\n\nOpus Labs CVBA will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.\n\nYour continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.\n\n#Refunds\n\nCertain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Opus Labs CVBA on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Opus Labs CVBA.\n\n#Accounts\n\nWhen you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times.

If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.\n\nLimitation Of Liability\n\nIn no event shall Opus Labs CVBA, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.\n\n#Disclaimer\n\nYour use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.\n\nOpus Labs CVBA its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.\n\n#Governing Law\n\nThese Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Belgium, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Disputes are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Ghent.\n\nOur failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.\n\n#Changes\n\nWe reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 15 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.\n\nBy continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
